# This is the expanation
In order to dry the code I had to run a loop through the transactions.
I had to keep the final code in order to have the right values but, all of the different lines for transactions is gone.
I also got rid of the first set of code and replaced it with the code that there is now.
It is much easier to read and it runs much faster.
